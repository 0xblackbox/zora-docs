##### Learn the first steps to getting started building with ZORA

---
ZORA V3 provides different types of market functionality that allows anyone to get started building with NFTs.
However, before being able to interact with specific functionality certain approvals must be granted to ZORA.

![zorav3diagram](../../static/img/zora_v3_diagram.png)

V3 is comprised of a few core contracts and an ever expanding set of modules. 
Modules are non-upgradable contracts that provide specific functionality.
The ZORA core contracts include **Token Transfer Helpers** and the **Module Mananger**.

- **Transfer Helper:** Handles transferring ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens for the modules
- **Module Manager:** Manages which modules a user has approved to use their tokens

### Required Approvals

Before being able to intereact with specific modules, there are a few approvals steps that are required.
First, any assets that are going to be moved by ZORA must have their respective Transfer Helper approved to the token contract.
For example, if you would like to sell an NFT, the ERC-721 Transfer Helper address must be approved to the NFT contract as an operator.
Second, once the assets have been approved to the Transfer Helpers, the nessary modules must be approved in the Module Manager by the user.

### Approving a Transfer Helper
Tokens must first be approved to the correct Transfer Helper before being able to be used by ZORA V3.
Note that a token approval to the ZORA Transfer Helpers will **only ever need to be done once per asset for a user**.
Once a token is approved to the Transfer Helper it can then be used by any approved V3 module.

##### ERC-721 
Selling an ERC-721 using ZORA V3 requires that the ERC-721 Transfer Helper has been approved as an operator and has access to move the NFT in the event of a sale.

**Note:** The ABIs for all ZORA V3 contracts can be found in the `@zoralabs/v3` npm package.
```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { erc721ABI, moduelManagerABI } from "../yourABIFile.js";

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(); // If you don't specify a url, Ethers connects to localhost
const erc721TransferHelperAddress = "0x909e9efE4D87d1a6018C2065aE642b6D0447bc91"; // Mainnet Ethereum
const nftContractAddress = "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"; // Blitmap NFT Contract

const erc721Contract = new ethers.Contract(nftContractAddress, erc721ABI, provider);
const moduelManagerContract = new ethers.Contract(moduleMananagerAddress, moduelManagerABI, provider);
```

First, check if the ERC-721 Transfer Helper has the ability to access the NFTs for the user's address. 
If not, submit a transaction either calling the `setApprovalForAll` to approve all NFTs or call `approve` to granually approve a specific `tokenId`.
```javascript
const approved = await erc721Contract.isApprovedForAll(owner, erc721TransferHelperAddress);
if(!approved) {
    await erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(erc721TransferHelperAddress, true);
}
// or check and approve a specific tokenId
const tokenId = "1";
const approvedAddress = await erc721Contract.getApproved(tokenId);
if(approvedAddress !== erc721TransferHelperAddress) {
    await erc721Contract.approve(erc721TransferHelperAddress, tokenId);
}
```

##### ERC-20
If a user needs to purchase an NFT with an ERC-20 they will first need to approve their tokens to the ERC-20 Transfer Helper.
```javascript
const approvedAmount = await erc20Contract.allowance(owner, erc721TransferHelperAddress);
const infiniteApproval = (2^256-1)
if(approvedAmount === 0) {
    await erc20Contract.approve(owner, erc721TransferHelperAddress, infiniteApproval);
}
```

---

### Approving Modules in the Module Manager
Once all the nessary tokens have been approved to the correct Transfer Helpers, 
the user will then need to submit a transaction to allow the correct ZORA modules to have access to their assets.
For example, if a user would like to sell an NFT via the `Asks v1.1 Module` they will need to allow that module to use their approved assets.
```javascript
const asks1_1_Address = "0x6170B3C3A54C3d8c854934cBC314eD479b2B29A3"; // Mainnet Ethereum
await moduelManagerContract.setApprovalForModule(asks1_1_Address, true);
```

Or a user can batch approve modules in single transaction by passing in an array of module addresses.
``` javascript
const zoraModuleAddresses = ["0x6170B3C3A54C3d8c854934cBC314eD479b2B29A3", "0x76744367ae5a056381868f716bdf0b13ae1aeaa3"]; // Asks v1.1 and Offers v1.0
await moduelManagerContract.setBatchApprovalForModules(
  zoraModuleAddresses, 
  true
);
```

Now that you have learned how to approve tokens to ZORA you are reading to begin interacting with the different ZORA V3 Modules.

### Revoking Access
At some point a user might want to revoke ZORA's abililty to access their assets. 
Approvals to ZORA can be revoked at any time and there are two ways to revoke.

#### Revoking Transfer Helper
By revoking access to the Transfer Helper you will remove the ability for all ZORA modules to be able to move the asset.

##### ERC-721

```javascript
const approved = await erc721Contract.isApprovedForAll(owner, erc721TransferHelperAddress);
if(approved) {
    await erc721Contract.setApprovalForAll(erc721TransferHelperAddress, false);
}
```

##### ERC-20 

```javascript
const approvedAmount = await erc20Contract.allowance(owner, erc721TransferHelperAddress);
if(approvedAmount !== "0") {
    await erc20Contract.approve(owner, erc721TransferHelperAddress, "0");
}
```

#### Revoking Module Manager
If you would like the ZORA Transfer Helpers to still have access to your assets, but you would like to restrict certain modules you can either revoke a singe module or batch revoke.
##### Single Module

```javascript
const asks1_1_Address = "0x6170B3C3A54C3d8c854934cBC314eD479b2B29A3"; // Mainnet Ethereum
await moduelManagerContract.setApprovalForModule(asks1_1_Address, false);
```
##### Multiple Modules
``` javascript
const zoraModuleAddresses = ["0x6170B3C3A54C3d8c854934cBC314eD479b2B29A3", "0x76744367ae5a056381868f716bdf0b13ae1aeaa3"]; // Asks v1.1 and Offers v1.0
await moduelManagerContract.setBatchApprovalForModules(
  zoraModuleAddresses, 
  false
);
```
