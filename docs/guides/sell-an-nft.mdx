##### Get started selling an NFT using the ZORA protocol

---
ZORA allows anyone to easily sell any ERC-721 NFT at a fixed price and comes with multiple benefits including:

- **Permissionless** - No one can stop or censor sales
- **No Protocol Fee** - ZORA doesn't take a cut of the final sale amount
- **Gas Efficient** - Almost 50% less gas than buying on OpenSea
- **Instant Royalty Payout** - Royalties are paid out as soon as the sale confirms

---

### Asks Module
ZORA V3 is composed of a few core contracts and an ever expanding set of modules. 
The `Asks Module` allows an ERC-721 NFT to be sold at a fixed price. 
This guide will walk you through how to interact with the `Asks v1.1`.

You can read more about the latest version of the `Asks Module` [here](/docs/smart-contracts/modules/Asks/zora-v3-asks-latest).

### Approving Tokens to ZORA
Before getting started with the `Asks Module`, we recommend that you check out our guide on how to [approve tokens to ZORA V3](/docs/guides/v3-approvals). 
TLDR, ZORA V3 requires that assets be approved to a Transfer Helper and the user must also approve the `Asks 1.1 Module` in the Module Manager.

---

### Creating an Ask
Once a user has approved their ERC-721 NFT to the ERC-721 Transfer Helper and approved the Asks Module in the Module Manager, they are ready to create an `ask`.
The core components of an `ask` are as follows:

```
struct Ask {
  address seller;
  address sellerFundsRecipient; 
  address askCurrency;
  uint16 findersFeeBps;
  uint256 askPrice;
}
```

* **seller:** The owner or approved address for an NFT
* **sellerFundsRecipient:** The address to send funds to once the NFT is sold
* **askCurrency:** ERC-20 token to accept, or address(0) for ETH
* **findersFeeBps:** The bps of the sale amount to be sent to the referrer of the sale
* **askPrice:** The sale price

##### Create Ask Parameters
```
function createAsk(
  address _tokenContract,
  uint256 _tokenId,
  uint256 _askPrice,
  address _askCurrency,
  address _sellerFundsRecipient,
  uint16 _findersFeeBps
)
```
##### Calling Create Ask
Imagine that I would like to sell a blitmap with `tokenId` 1.
After approving the ERC-721 Transfer Helper to be able to move my blitmaps and approving the `Asks 1.1 Module` in the Module Manger, I am ready to create an `ask`.
In the example below, I am setting the sale price to 100 ETH.
If I were pricing the NFT in an ERC-20 I would pass in the ERC-20 token address as the `askCurrency`.
However, since I am pricing the sale in ETH I am passing in the `0 address`.

Lastly, I am adding an incentive by setting the Finders Fee to 2% (200 Basis Points) of the sale amount. 
Meaning whoever helps find the buyer for this NFT will recieve a 2 ETH reward (100 ETH x 2%).
```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { AsksV11__factory } from "@zoralabs/v3/dist/typechain/factories/AsksV11__factory";
import addressesMainnet from "@zoralabs/v3/dist/addresses/1.json";

// If you don't specify a url, Ethers connects to localhost 
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();

const blitmapAddress = "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"; // Blitmap NFT Contract
const askPrice = ethers.utils.parseEther("100") // 100 ETH Sale Price
const ownerAddress = "0xF296178d553C8Ec21A2fBD2c5dDa8CA9ac905A00";
const findersFeeBps = "200"; // 2% Finders Fee (in BPS)

const askModuleContract = AsksV11__factory.connect(addressesMainnet.AsksV1_1, signer);
await askModuleContract.createAsk(
  blitmapAddress,
  "1", // Token Id
  askPrice,
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // 0 address for ETH sale
  ownerAddress,
  findersFeeBps
);
```

##### Setting the Finders Fee
The Finders Fee is an optional amount that can be included when an `ask` is created.
This amount can be awarded to the party that helped matched the buyer to the NFT.
The Finders Fee is set in basis points, so if you wanted 1% of the sale amount to go to the finder then you would set `findersFeeBps` to 100 (1% x 100).

---

### Filling an Ask
Once an `ask` has been created it can be filled by anyone. 
If the NFT is priced in an ERC-20 token then the person trying to fill the `ask` must approve their tokens to the [ERC-20 Transfer Helper](/docs/guides/v3-approvals#approving-a-transfer-helper) 
and then approve the `Ask 1.1 Module` in the Module Manager.


```
function fillAsk(
    address _tokenContract,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    address _fillCurrency,
    uint256 _fillAmount,
    address _finder
) 
```

```javascript
const blitmapAddress = "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"; // Blitmap NFT Contract
const fillAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("100"); // 100 ETH Sale Price
const finder = "0xF296178d553C8Ec21A2fBD2c5dDa8CA9ac905A00"; // Can be the 0 address if no address is specified

await askModuleContract.fillAsk(
  blitmapAddress,
  "1", // Token Id
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // 0 address for ETH sale
  fillAmount,
  finder
);
```

##### The Finder Address 
The `finder` address can be set to the `0 address` if no address is provided. 
This will skip over the Finders Fee logic in the contract and will send the total sale amount to the seller's address.

---

### Updating an Ask
An `ask` can be updated at anytime, but it can only be updated by the owner of the NFT.
```
function setAskPrice(
  address _tokenContract,
  uint256 _tokenId,
  uint256 _askPrice,
  address _askCurrency
) 
```
In this case I am updating the price from 100 ETH to 110 ETH.
```javascript
const blitmapAddress = "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"; // Blitmap NFT Contract
const askPrice = ethers.utils.parseEther("110"); // 110 ETH Sale Price

await askModuleContract.setAskPrice(
  blitmapAddress,
  "1", // Token Id
  askPrice,
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // 0 address for ETH sale
);
```

--- 

### Cancelling an Ask
An `ask` can be cancelled by either the token owner or an approved operator. 
Note that transferring an NFT from the address that originally created the ask will temporarily invalidate the `ask`.
However, if the NFT is ever transferred back to the original address then the `ask` will become valid again.
It is always a best to directly cancel an open `ask` rather than transfer the NFT to a different address.
```
function cancelAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)

```

```javascript
const blitmapAddress = "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"; // Blitmap NFT Contract

await askModuleContract.cancelAsk(
  blitmapAddress,
  "1", // Token Id
);
```
