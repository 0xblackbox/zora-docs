title: Connect a Wallet in React

Guide to connecting the user's wallet in react.

---

The ZORA Development Kit (ZDK) requires a connection to a node to both read from the blockchain and submit transactions.
By having a user connect their wallet to your application, you can communicate to a node through their wallet.

:::note

If your application _only_ needs to read data from the blockchain, we recommend using the [ZORA indexer](../developer-tools/indexer/introduction) which doesn't require a connection to a node. 

:::

If you need to submit a transaction, you will need to provide an [ethers signer](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/) for signing transactions.
The ZORA team typically uses [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) or [web3modal](https://github.com/web3modal/web3modal) to connect the user's wallet. 
Once you set up these libraries, you can then use that provider for the ZDK.

```typescript 
import { useWeb3React } from '@web3-react/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const { library, chainId } = useWeb3React()
  // library is a ethers provider/signer instance
  // Ethereum Mainnet (1) Rinkeby (4) for the chainId 

  const auctionHouse = useMemo(() => {
    if (library && chainId) {
      return new AuctionHouse(library.getSigner(), chainId)
    }
  }, [library, chainId])
  return auctionHouse ? (
    <ManageAuction auctionHouse={auctionHouse} />
  ) : (
    <div>Please connect wallet</div>
  )
}
```

#### Hosted URLs

If you want to allow easy bidding and listing of NFTs, ZORA supports hosted urls where the user can interact with ZORA
interface to list their NFTs or bid on NFTs without needing to setup any wallet login and the user can trust the [ZORA.co](https://zora.co/) site.

```typescript
https://zora.co/auctions/{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}/list
// Lists the given token for an auction house auction

https://zora.co/auctions/{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}/bid
// Allows the user to bid on the active auction for the given token
```
