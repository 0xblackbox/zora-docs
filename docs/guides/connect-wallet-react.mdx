Guide to connecting the user's wallet in react.

---

The ZORA ZDK requires a connection to a node in order to both get data from the blockchain and submit transactions.
By having a user connect their wallet to your application, you are able to communicate to a node through their wallet.

If your application only needs to read data from the blockchain using the ZDK, an [ethers provider](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/) can be used. 
If you need to submit a transaction, you should provide an ethers signer, a type of provider that can sign transactions.

The ZORA team typically uses [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) to connect the user's wallet or [web3modal](https://github.com/web3modal/web3modal). Once you set up
these libraries, you can then use that provider for the ZDK.

```typescript 
import { useWeb3React } from '@web3-react/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const { library, chainId } = useWeb3React()
  // library is a ethers provider/signer instance
  // chainId is the networkId

  const auctionHouse = useMemo(() => {
    if (library && chainId) {
      return new AuctionHouse(library.getSigner(), chainId)
    }
  }, [library, chainId])
  return auctionHouse ? (
    <ManageAuction auctionHouse={auctionHouse} />
  ) : (
    <div>Please connect wallet</div>
  )
}
```

If you want to allow easy bidding and listing of NFTs, ZORA supports hosted urls where the user can interact with ZORA
interface to list their NFTs or bid on NFTs without needing to setup any wallet login and the user can trust the ZORA.co site.

```typescript
https://zora.co/auctions/{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}/list
// Lists the given token for an auction house auction

https://zora.co/auctions/{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}/bid
// Allows the user to bid on the active auction for the given token
```
