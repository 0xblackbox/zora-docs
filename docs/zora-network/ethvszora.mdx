# Ethereum vs Zora

---

Zora harnesses the Bedrock release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is purposely structured to mimic Ethereum as closely as possible. 
Still, there exist slight differences in the behavior of Zora compared to Ethereum. 


When building applications on Zora, these nuances should be noted:
- New blocks are created every 2 seconds on Zora.
- The gas limit for a Zora block is 30,000,000.
- [OP Codes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [RPC API](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Tx Costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)
