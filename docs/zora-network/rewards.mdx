# Creator Rewards

---

## Introduction

The recently introduced Zora Network has opened up experimentation for creators, collectors, and developers monetizing their work.

**Creator Rewards** is the latest offering from Zora, providing creators a split of the 0.000999 ETH fee on free open editions, enabling them to monetize their work without charging their communities.

## How It Works

1. Creator selects the **"Free + Rewards"** pricing option when creating their 721 or 1155 open edition
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator opens up their edition for minting -- **that's it!**

The creator's total ETH generated from rewards is aggregated into one rewards balance and can claimed at any time.
