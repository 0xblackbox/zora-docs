# Subgraph

The Zora Subgraph, is an open implementation of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ourzora/zora-v1) for the Zora Protocol. It syncs with the blockchain and indexes pertinent data about Zora cryptomedia. It also provides an easy to use GraphQL interface for developers to easily query synced data from the Zora Protocol.

The Graph offers a hosted service for public interaction with the Zora Subgraph. Alternatively, you can run your own graph-node with a Zora Subgraph by following the Graph's [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/network#indexing) and joining their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vtvv7FP).
