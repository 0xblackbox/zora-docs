In addition to the [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/ourzora/zora-v1) on Graph Protocol,
Zora maintains its own indexer that serves a GraphQL API full of useful information about the Zora protocol and
the entire NFT universe. 

The Indexer watches the Zora Media, Market, and Auction House contracts as well as a set of arbitrary ERC-721
contracts. Indexer also regularly fetches and refreshes ERC-721 metadata json data, so clients can query NFTs by their
metadata properties. Currently Indexer only watches Ethereum networks, but is extensible to include other EVM networks.

Begin making example queries in our hosted GraphQL [playground](https://ourzora.github.io/indexer-playground/) on both
Rinkeby and Mainnet.
