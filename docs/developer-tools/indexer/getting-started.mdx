## Querying the Indexer

To query against the Indexer's GraphQL API simply make a **POST** request the indexer query url.

```bash
https://indexer-prod-mainnet.zora.co/v1/graphql
```

If you are making an unauthenticated request, make sure to include **X-Hasura-Role: anonymous** in the header of the request.

### Fetching a Zora NFT

To fetch the rich information from Zora NFTs, use the **Media** table. The example query fetches the last 100 NFTs minted
on the Zora Media contract.

```graphql
Media(order_by: { tokenId: desc}, limit: 100){
    tokenId
    creator
    creatorBidShare
    owner
    contentURI
    metadataURI
    contentHash
    metadataHash
    metadata {
      json
    }
  }
```

### Fetching any NFT

You can directly query for any NFT by querying the **Token** table. The example query fetches the first 100 tokenIds for the
[Blitmap](https://www.blitmap.com/) collection. You can check to see which NFT contracts are supported by querying the
**TokenContract** table.

```graphql
 Token(where: { address: { _eq: "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"}}, order_by: { tokenId: asc} limit: 100){
    tokenId
    address
    minter
    owner
    metadata {
      json
    }
}
```

### Fetching a Zora Auction

You can query for a Zora Auction by using the **Auction** table. The example query fetches the auctions that have had
their reserve price met, but have not been finalized (listed in order of auctionId).

```graphql
Auction(where: { lastBidder: { _is_null: false}, _not: {endedEvent: {}} }, order_by: { auctionId: desc}, limit:10) {
    tokenContract
    tokenId
    tokenOwner
    auctionCurrency
    reservePrice
    curator
    curatorFee
    approved
    expiresAt
    winner
    lastBidder
    lastBidAmount
  }
```
