ZORA's custom indexer that allows for easy retrieval of NFT related data

---

ZORA maintains its own indexer that serves a GraphQL API and provides information about the ZORA protocol and
the broader NFT ecosystem. 

<!-- **[Indexer Diagram goes here]** -->

The Indexer watches ZORA's smart contracts as well as any ERC-721
NFT contract. It also regularly fetches and refreshes ERC-721 metadata json data, so clients can query NFTs by their
metadata properties. The Indexer currently only watches Ethereum Mainnet and Rinkeby Testnest, but will be extended to include other EVM networks in the future.

:::note

You can begin making queries in our hosted GraphQL [playground](https://ourZORA.github.io/indexer-playground/) on both Ethereum Mainnet and Rinkeby.

## Querying the Indexer

To query against the Indexer's GraphQL API for the `Ethereum Mainnet` make a `POST` request to the indexer query url.

```bash
https://indexer-prod-mainnet.ZORA.co/v1/graphql
```

If you are making an unauthenticated request, make sure to include **X-Hasura-Role: anonymous** in the header of the request.

### Fetching zNFT Info

You can use the **Media** table to fetch information on ZORA NFTs (zNFTs). This example query fetches the last 100 NFTs minted
out of the ZORA Media contract.

```gql
{
  Media(order_by: { tokenId: desc}, limit: 100){
    tokenId
    creator
    creatorBidShare
    owner
    contentURI
    metadataURI
    contentHash
    metadataHash
    metadata {
      json
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetching any NFT

You can directly query for any ERC-721 NFT by querying the `Token` table. The example query fetches the first 100 tokenIds for the
Blitmap NFT contract. You can check to see which NFT contracts are supported by querying the
`TokenContract` table.

```gql
{
  Token(where: { address: { _eq: "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63"}}, order_by: { tokenId: asc} limit: 100){
    tokenId
    address
    minter
    owner
    metadata {
      json
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetching a ZORA Auction

You can query for a ZORA Auction by using the `Auction` table. The example query fetches the auctions that have had
their reserve price met, but have not been finalized (listed in order of `auctionId`).

```gql
{
  Auction(where: { lastBidder: { _is_null: false}, _not: {endedEvent: {}} }, order_by: { auctionId: desc}, limit:10) {
    tokenContract
    tokenId
    tokenOwner
    auctionCurrency
    reservePrice
    curator
    curatorFee
    approved
    expiresAt
    winner
    lastBidder
    lastBidAmount
  }
}
```
