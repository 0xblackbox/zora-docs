Tools that help format Metadata when minting ZORA NFTs

---

In the original ERC-721 specification, it was suggested that tokens should link to a metadata URI that contains a link to the specific content of the token within that JSON. 
However, in the event that the URI for the content and metadata ever had to be changed, there would be no way for the public to ensure the integrity of both the metadata and content.
:::note

The ZORA protocol explicitly separates content URIs and metadata URIs and provides a `sha256` checksum for each. This allows anyone the ability to quickly verify the integrity of hosted media at any time.
:::

In order to allow the ZORA community to integrate with your metadata schema, we provide a [media metadata schema repository](https://github.com/ourzora/media-metadata-schemas),
that can serve as the source of truth for community supported metadata schemas. These schemas are defined as JSON schemas,
and generate Types, Parsers, Generators, and Validators that are automatically served through the ZDK.

## Generate Metadata

Given a schema version and some unformatted JSON, this method generates a valid, minified, and alphabetized JSON object.

```typescript
import { generateMetadata } from '@zoralabs/zdk'

const metadata = {
  version: 'zora-20200101', // The version of metadata you are generating
  name: someName,
  description: someDescription,
  mimeType: someMimeType, // Media type: audio, image, etc etc 
}

const minified = generateMetadata(metadata.version, metadata)
```

## Validate Metadata

```typescript
import { validateMetadata } from '@zoralabs/zdk'

const metadata = {
  version: 'zora-20210101',
  name: randomName,
  description: randomDescription,
  mimeType: mimeType,
}

const isValid = validateMetadata(metadata.version, metadata)
```

## Parse Metadata

```typescript
import { parseMetadata } from '@zoralabs/zdk'

const metadata = `
  {
    version: 'zora-20210101',
    name: randomName,
    description: randomDescription,
    mimeType: mimeType,
  }
`
const parsed = parseMetadata('zora-20210101', metadata)
```

## Define a new Schema

To define a new schema, visit the [metadata schema repository](https://github.com/ourzora/media-metadata-schemas) and follow the instructions in the README.
