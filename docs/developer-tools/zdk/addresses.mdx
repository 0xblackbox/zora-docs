Provides ZORA contract addresses for different networks

---

In order to reference the officially supported addresses of the ZORA protocol on different networks,
we provide a module for exporting the addresses as string constants.

To retrieve the addresses, simply import the module as shown below:

```js
import { addresses } from '@zoralabs/sdk'

const rinkebyMedia = addresses['rinkeby'].media
const rinkebyMarket = addresses['rinkeby'].market
```
