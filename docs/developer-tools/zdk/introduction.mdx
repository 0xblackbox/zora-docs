The ZORA Development Kit (ZDK) makes it easy to interact with the ZORA Protocol

---

<br/>

The ZDK has a couple key components, which can be used to read and write to the ZORA protocol:
* [ZORA NFT Module:](/docs/developer-tools/zdk/zora-nfts) Provides read and write access to the ZORA NFT contracts

* [Auction House Module:](/docs/developer-tools/zdk/auction-house) Tools for making it easy to sell any ERC-721 NFT

* [Utility Module:](/docs/developer-tools/zdk/utility) Utility tools to simplify interacting with the ZDK

* [Metadata Module:](/docs/developer-tools/zdk/metadata) Tools to help format Metadata when minting ZORA NFTs

* [User Info Module:](/docs/developer-tools/zdk/user-info) Maps Ethereum addresses to ZORA user profiles

* [Addresses Module:](/docs/developer-tools/zdk/addresses) Allows for quick access of ZORA contract addresses on different supported networks

## Getting started

You can install the developer kit with either ```yarn``` or ```npm```

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @zoralabs/zdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install -S @zoralabs/zdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connecting to Ethers.js 

The ZDK exposes utilities for the [ZORA Smart Contracts](../smart-contracts/smart-contracts) and uses an [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) interface to interact with the Zora ecosystem.

:::note

[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) is a javascript library that is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

:::

In order for your application to interact with the blockchain, you will need to establish a connection to a node. 
This can be done by passing an RPC url from a node provider into ethers.js. 
If you are trying to test out the SDK you can set up an [Infura](https://infura.io/product/ethereum) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/supernode) account. 

In addition, users can pass in a connection to a node when they connect their wallet to your application.
We have a guide on how to [connect a wallet in React](../../guides/react-connect-wallet) if you are curious on how to have a user connect their wallet.


```typescript
import { Zora } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const rpcURL = // you will get this from Infura or Alchemy 

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcURL);

let wallet = Wallet.createRandom()
wallet = wallet.connect(provider)

const zora = new Zora(wallet, 1) //passing in 1 for Ethereum Mainnet
const totalSupply = await zora.fetchTotalMedia()

console.log(totalSupply) // total supply of ZORA NFTs minted on the Ethereum Mainnet
```
