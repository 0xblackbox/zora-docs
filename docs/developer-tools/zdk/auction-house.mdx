Tools for selling an ERC-721 NFT

---

The ZORA Auction House is an open and permissionless system that allows any creator, community, or DAO to buy or sell an NFT.
This part of the ZDK provides easy access to the Auction House contract.

<!-- **[Auction House diagram goes here]** -->

## Constructor

Similarly to instantiating the `ZORA NFT Module`, the `Auction House Module` requires an ethers.js `Signer` or `Provider`,
and the `chainID` of the network you are interacting with.

You can learn more about connecting to ethers.js [here](./introduction#connecting-to-ethersjs)

| **Name**         | **Type**           | **Description**                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| signerOrProvider | Signer \| Provider | The Wallet or JSON RPC Provider connected to Ethereum                   |
| chainId          | number             | The `chainID` for the network. 1 for Ethereum Mainnet, or 4 for Rinkeby |

<br />{' '}

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)
```

## Auction Interface

Auctions are returned via the ZDK with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Auction {
  approved: boolean
  amount: BigNumber
  duration: BigNumber
  firstBidTime: BigNumber
  reservePrice: BigNumber
  curatorFeePercentage: number
  tokenOwner: string
  bidder: string
  curator: string
  auctionCurrency: string
}
```

## Read Functions

---

All the functions that are able to get data from the ZORA Auction House smart contract.
We recommend using the [Zora Indexer](../indexer/introduction#fetching-a-zora-auction) if you only need to get Auction House data.

### Get an Auction

| **Name**  | **Type**     | **Description**                                |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| auctionId | BigNumberish | The ID for the auction you are trying to fetch |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)

await auctionHouse.fetchAuction(auctionId)
```

### Get an Auction from a Transaction Receipt

If you've just created an auction, it may be useful to fetch the auction immediately after it was created.
You can do this via the ZDK by simply passing the ethers.js Transaction Receipt from the transaction in which
you created the auction.

| **Name** | **Type**           | **Description**                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| receipt  | TransactionReceipt | The receipt from the transaction in which the auction was created |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()

// 1. Connect to the Auction House
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)

// 2. Create an Auction
const createAuctionTx = await auctionHouse.createAuction(
  tokenId,
  duration,
  reservePrice,
  curator,
  curatorFeePercentage,
  auctionCurrency
)

// 3. Await confirmation from the Ethereum Network and receive a receipt
const receipt = await createAuctionTx.wait()

// 4. Finally, get the auction information from the transaction receipt
const auction = await auctionHouse.fetchAuctionFromTransactionReceipt(receipt)
```

## Write Functions

---

All the write functions are able to submit transactions to ZORA Auction House smart contract.

### Create an Auction

In order to create an auction, the owner approves their NFT to be used and specifies the auction
parameters.

| **Name**             | **Type**     | **Description**                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tokenId              | BigNumberish | The ID of the token                                                                                                             |
| duration             | BigNumberish | The length of time to run the auction for, in seconds                                                                           |
| reservePrice         | BigNumberish | The minimum price of the first bid                                                                                              |
| curator              | string       | The address for the auction curator, or the zero address for an uncurated auction                                               |
| curatorFeePercentage | number       | The % of this auction's highest bid to award the auction curator once the auction has completed                                 |
| auctionCurrency      | string       | The address of the ERC-20 contract in which this auction can be run. If set to the zero address, the auction will be run in ETH |
| tokenAddress         | string       | [optional] The address of the NFT contract the token is coming from. If not specified, the Zora protocol is assumed.            |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse, Zora } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()

// 1. Connect to the Auction House and ZORA Protocol
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)
const zora = new Zora(wallet, 1)

// 2. Approve the media to be placed on auction
const approvalTx = await zora.approve(auctionHouse.address, tokenId)

// 3. Await confirmation of the approval
await approvalTx.wait()

// 3. Create the Auction
const createAuctionTx = await auctionHouse.createAuction(
  tokenId,
  duration,
  reservePrice,
  curator,
  curatorFeePercentage,
  auctionCurrency
)
```

### Approve an auction

If there is a curator, they can approve any auction in which they have been specified as the curator. Doing so effectively
opens up the auction for bidding to take place.

| **Name**  | **Type**     | **Description**                        |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| auctionId | BigNumberish | The ID for the auction                 |
| approved  | boolean      | Whether or not the auction is approved |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const curatorWallet = Wallet.createRandom()
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(curatorWallet, 1)

await auctionHouse.setAuctionApproval(auctionId, true)
```

### Create a bid

If an auction has been approved, any address is able to submit a bid.

| **Name**  | **Type**     | **Description**                                                 |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| auctionId | BigNumberish | The ID of the auction                                           |
| amount    | BigNumberish | The amount of the auction's specified currency to be bidding in |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)

await auctionHouse.createBid(auctionId, amount)
```

### End an Auction

Once an auction's timer has run out, any address is able to end the auction.

Ending an auction pays out the auction creator
and curator, and transfers the NFT to the winner. If the auction was created for a Zora NFT, the auction also respects
perpetual equity for the creator and any bid shares that may be present.

| **Name**  | **Type**     | **Description**       |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| auctionId | BigNumberish | The ID of the auction |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)

await auctionHouse.endAuction(auctionId)
```

### Cancel an Auction

If an auction has not received any bids yet, either the curator or creator may choose to cancel the auction. Doing
so returns the NFT to the original owner and removes the auction from the directory.

| **Name**  | **Type**     | **Description**        |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| auctionId | BigNumberish | The ID for the auction |

```typescript
import { AuctionHouse } from '@zoralabs/zdk'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const wallet = Wallet.createRandom()
const auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse(wallet, 1)

await auctionHouse.cancelAuction(auctionId)
```
