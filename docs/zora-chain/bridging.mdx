# Bridging

---

### Bridging ETH => Zora 

ETH can be bridged from Ethereum (L1) to Zora (L2) by sending it to the contract address below. 
It will take about 10-15 minutes for funds to show up on the Zora network. 
You must also set the gas limit to 100,000 instead of 21,000 for the transaction to be successful.

** Warning: ** Please do not send large amounts of ETH to Layer 2.
It is recommended to send a small amount of ETH when bridging for the first time.
Lastly, **do not** send WETH or any ERC-20 tokens to the bridge address.
