# Introduction to the API

##### ZORA API: The one-stop shop for all your NFT data needs

---

The ZORA API is a **GraphQL API** that makes it easy to retrieve NFT metadata at scale, create your own marketplace, analyze sales activity, monitor on-chain events, and much more.

##### Key Features:
- Standardized NFT Metadata
- NFT Contract Events
- Marketplace Sales Data (ZORA, OpenSea, LooksRare, 0x, etc.)
- Adaptable to Different Chains and Token Standards
- Automatically syncs new NFTs deployed to the blockchain


## Getting Started
If you are unfamilar with GraphQL, we recommend that you [check out this resource](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/). 
In addition, here are some key considerations to take into account before using the API.

- The API currently only supports `ERC-721` NFTs on `Ethereum Mainnet` . However, we plan to support other chains and tokens standards in the near future.
- All queries can be run without specifying arguments, but it is suggested the you provide arguments for quicker responses.
- Maximum nodes allowed in a response is 500, but it can be set to a specific size within the `pagination` argument.
- There is a list of [sample queries here](./zora-api-sample-queries) that will help you get started with simple API queries.

- `query`: General arguments that grab a specific set of NFT data
- `filter`:  Filters down the results from the `query` arguments into a smaller data set
- `pagination`:  A way to set the size and starting point of the response
- `sort`: Sorts the returned data
