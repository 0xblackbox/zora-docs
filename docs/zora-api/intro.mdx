# Introduction to the API

##### ZORA API: The one-stop shop for all your NFT data needs

---

The ZORA API is a **GraphQL API** that makes it easy to retrieve NFT metadata at scale, create your own marketplace, analyze sales activity, monitor on-chain events, and much more. 
:::note
GraphiQL Playground: https://api.zora.co/graphql

API Endpoint: https://api.zora.co

[Sample Queries](./zora-api-sample-queries)

:::

### Features
- Standardized NFT Metadata
- NFT Contract Events
- Provides Marketplace Sales Data (ZORA, OpenSea, LooksRare, 0x, etc.)
- Adaptable to Different Chains and Token Standards
- Automatically syncs newly deployed NFT contracts

---

## Getting Started
If you are unfamilar with GraphQL, we recommend that you [check out this resource](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/). 
In addition, here are a few considerations to take into account before using the API.

- We've created a list of [sample queries](./zora-api-sample-queries) and an [API guide](../guides/api-punks-market) to help you get started.
- Currently only supports `ERC-721` NFTs on `Ethereum Mainnet`. 
- We are working to support other chains and tokens standards in the near future.
- You can make up to 60 requests per minute without needing a key.
- Maximum nodes in a response is 500, but can be set to a certain size with `pagination`.

## Queries

### Core Entities

- `token`: Information about a single token
- `tokens`: Information for multiple tokens
- `collections`: NFT collection information
- `events`: Contract event information, e.g. Sales, Transfers, Mints, Market events
- `markets`: Data for specific ZORA markets, e.g. Buy Now, Auctions, Offers
- `sales`: Historical sales data from ZORA, OpenSea, LooksRare, 0x, and more
- `tokenMarkets`: Retrieve token, market data, and event information

### Aggregated Entities

- `aggregateAttributes`: Gets the total set of NFT attributes
- `aggregateStat`: Returns counts, sales volume, and other useful statistics

---

## Query Arguments

- `networks`: The network and chain to grab NFT data from
- `where`: General arguments that grab a specific set of NFT data
- `filter`:  Filters down the results from the `query` arguments into a smaller data set
- `pagination`:  A way to set the size and starting point of the response
- `sort`: Sorts the returned data

---

## Example Collections

Weâ€™ve indexed collections from all across `Ethereum Mainnet`. 
Here are a few example collections you can use to test the API with.

- `Zorbs`: 0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152
- `Crypto Dickbutts`: 0x42069ABFE407C60cf4ae4112bEDEaD391dBa1cdB

## Navigating GraphiQL

This section provides an overview of how to use GraphiQL to test the API.

:::note
#### Sample Queries
We have created is a list of [example queries here](./zora-api-sample-queries) that you can test out.

GraphiQL Playground: https://api.zora.co/graphql
:::

#### Explorer

The explorer allows you to quickly view the different possible queries. 
To access the explorer, click on the "Explorer" button at the top. 

![explorer-button](../../static/img/graphiQL/qlNavBar.png)

You will then see a pop out on the left side of the screen. 
This section will show you all the possible queries along with their paramaters.
GraphiQL will populate the queries into the sandbox if you click on them.

#### Docs

The Docs section of GraphiQL can be access by clicking on "Docs" in the top left of the page. 

<img src="../../static/img/graphiQL/graphiqlDocs.png" alt="doc-tabs" height="250"/>


This will pop out the docs section and if you click into "Root Query" you will be able to view the types for both the arguments and the responses.
