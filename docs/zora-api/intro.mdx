# Introduction

##### The Most Powerful NFT API

---

The ZORA API makes it easy to retrieve NFT metadata, monitor on-chain events, analyze sales activity, and so much more. 

:::note

✨ **You can test out the API without needing a key. It’s free to use right now** ✨

API Endpoint: https://api.zora.co/graphql

[SDK](./zdk): A development kit to use the API without needing to know GraphQL

[NFT Hooks](../developer-tools/nft-hooks/intro): A tool that makes NFT data retrieval even easier than the ZDK

:::
## Key Features
- Sales info from every marketplace (ZORA, OpenSea, LooksRare etc.)
- Data on every Ethereum NFT contract (Transfers, Mints, etc.)
- Media is encoded to provide assets at different sizes
- Automatically syncs newly deployed NFT contracts
- Fill orders made on OpenSea (Seaport)
- Text-based search for discoverability
- And much more

---

## Supported Networks
The API is expanding to more networks and currently supports:

Network     | ChainId | Status             |
------------|---------|--------------------|
ETH Mainnet | 1       |   Entire History   |
Goerli      | 5       |   Tip of Chain     |

## Getting Started
If you are unfamiliar with GraphQL, we recommend that you [check out this resource](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/). 
In addition, here are a few considerations before using the API.

- The [ZDK](./zdk) and [NFT Hooks](../developer-tools/nft-hooks/intro) allows anyone to build top on of the API without needing to know GraphQL.
- Currently supports any `ERC-721` NFTs
- Maximum page size limit is `500` for regular queries and `50` for text-based searches
- Check out the guides section to begin building

## Authentication

Anyone can use the API **without an API key** as long as the application is making **less than 120 requests per minute.**

| **Needs**                 | **API Key Requirements**|
| ------------------------- | ---------------------   |
| Less than 120 requests per minute  | **No Key Needed**           |
| Greater than 120 requests per minute   | Key Needed              |

You can get an API key [here](https://keys.api.zora.co/) if your needs require **greater than 120 requests per mintue.**
To access the API with a key, add a header in your requests with the key `X-API-KEY` .

```
headers={"X-API-KEY": <your_api_key>}
```
