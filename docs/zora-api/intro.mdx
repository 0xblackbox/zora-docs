# Introduction

##### The Most Powerful NFT API

---

The ZORA API uses **GraphQL** to make it easy to retrieve NFT metadata, monitor on-chain events, analyze NFT sales activity, and much more. 
:::note

API Endpoint: https://api.zora.co/graphql

[SDK](./zdk-api): Use the API without needing to know GraphQL

:::
## Key Features
- Every Ethereum NFT contract and its associated events (Transfer, Mint, Sales, etc.)
- Sales data from every marketplace (ZORA, OpenSea, LooksRare, 0x, etc.)
- Media is encoded to provide assets at different sizes
- Automatically syncs newly deployed NFT contracts
- Adaptable to any chain and token standard
- Text based search
- ENS compatible

## Getting Started
If you are unfamilar with GraphQL, we recommend that you [check out this resource](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/). 
In addition, here are a few considerations before using the API.

- The [ZDK](./zdk-api) allows anyone to build top on of the API without needing to know GraphQL.
- Check out our guides to help you get going.
- The API currently supports any `ERC-721` NFTs on `Ethereum Mainnet`. 
- Other chains and tokens standards will be added in the near future.
- Maximum size in a response is **500** and can be set to a certain size with `pagination`.

## Example Collections

Weâ€™ve indexed collections from all across `Ethereum Mainnet`. 
Here are a few NFT contract addresses to test the API with.

- `Zorbs`: 0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152
- `Crypto Dickbutts`: 0x42069ABFE407C60cf4ae4112bEDEaD391dBa1cdB
- `Crypto Coven`: 0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8

## Navigating GraphiQL

This section provides an overview of how to use [GraphiQL](https://api.zora.co/graphql) to test the API.


### Explorer

The explorer allows anyone to quickly view the different possible queries. 
To access the explorer, click on the "Explorer" button at the top. 

![explorer-button](../../static/img/graphiQL/qlNavBar.png)

You will then see a pop out on the left side of the screen. 
This section will show you all the possible queries along with their paramaters.
GraphiQL will populate the queries into the sandbox if you click on them.

We recommend that you format the response of your query by clicking into the nodes section and selection what you would like to have returned.
