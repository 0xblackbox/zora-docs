After receiving your report, our security team will confirm and begin investigating the issue. We'll keep you updated along the way and request more details if required. For the same issue, we'll consider only the first report meeting our criteria

### Bug Bounty Rewards

- Reward of up to 25 ETH for any **critical** bugs that could result in loss of funds.
- Rewards may be awarded for smaller bugs or improvements that are classified as valid. This will depend on the following considerations; the exploit scenario, product found in, likelihood and impact.

### Out of scope vulnerabilities    

- Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DDOS/DOS).
- Vulnerabilities that require physical access to a user's device.
- Attacks requiring leaked keys or credentials.
- Missing or incorrect SPF records of any kind.
- Missing or incorrect DMARC records of any kind.
- Theoretical attacks without proof of exploitability.

### Program Rules

- Social engineering targeted to Zora employees is prohibited.
- Submit one vulnerability per report.
- Vulnerabilities that Zora is aware of will not be rewarded.
- Please provide thorough reports with clear steps that can be replicated. If the report lacks sufficient detail to reproduce the issue, it may not be accepted.
- When duplicates occur, we will only accept to the first report that was received, as long as it fulfills our submission criteria and can be fully reproduced.



### Disclosure Policy

To ensure responsible handling of vulnerability disclosures, it is crucial to keep all discussions of such vulnerabilities (even those that have already been resolved) within the program and not disclose them externally within 90 days of remediation or without Zora's express approval. Failure to comply with the Disclosure Policy will result in forfeiture of any eligible reward. Be confident that you are adhering to this policy and contributing to the safety and integrity of the program.
