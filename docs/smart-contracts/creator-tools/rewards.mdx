## Introduction

At Zora, we are passionate about providing creators the best experience to create and earn on Ethereum.

Our latest offering, **Creator Rewards**, provides creators a split of our 0.000999 ETH fee on free open editions, allowing them to monetize their work without charging their communities.

## How It Works

1. Creator selects the **"Free + Rewards"** pricing option when creating their 721 or 1155 open edition
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator opens up their edition for minting -- **that's it!**

The creator's total ETH generated from rewards is aggregated into an escrow contract and can withdrawn at any time.
