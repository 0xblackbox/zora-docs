##### Creator contracts make it easy to deploy and sell an NFT collection

---

These contracts allow anyone to deploy an NFT collection in seconds.
The `ZoraNFTCreator` factory contract deploys gas-optimized NFT contracts.

In addition, these contracts **provide built-in sales mechanics**, making it easy to both deploy a collection and sell the initial mints.

## Edition vs Drop

- `Drop`: All the NFTs have individual pieces of media.
