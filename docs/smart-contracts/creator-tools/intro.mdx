##### Creator contracts make it easy to deploy and sell an NFT collection

---

These contracts allow anyone to deploy an NFT collection in seconds.
In addition, these contracts **provide built-in sales mechanics**, making it easy to both deploy a collection and sell the initial mints.

## Edition vs Drop

These contracts can make two different types of NFT collections:

- `Edition`: All the NFTs share the same media asset.
- `Drop`: All the NFTs have individual pieces of media.


## 1155 vs 721

- `1155`: Editions are stored in the same contract. Recommended for creating editions.
- `721`: All NFTs have unique id numbers. Recommended for creating drops.
