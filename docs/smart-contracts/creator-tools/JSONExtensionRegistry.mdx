##### JSONExtensionRegistry
---

This contract is a extension registry for any address or contract owned by another address to reference a theming configuration file on-chain to update their zora.co minting profile.

This contract is statically deployed at: [0xABCDEFEd93200601e1dFe26D6644758801D732E8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xABCDEFEd93200601e1dFe26D6644758801D732E8) on g√∂rli and mainnet. We will deploy on further chains as needed and we use an open CREATE2 bytecode-based deploy scheme where anyone can deploy this hyperstructure to any chain as desired.

## Updating your configuration

`function setJSONExtension(address target, string memory uri) external;`

Call this function to set the JSON extension for your own address or an owned target address. We lookup ownership first via `AccessControl` then the `owner()` function.

## Reading your configuration

`function getJSONExtension(address target) external returns (string memory);`

This function gets the latest registered JSON extension file.

## Checking your admin status

`function getIsAdmin(address target, address expectedAdmin) external view returns (bool);`

For front-ends checking for updates you can use the `getIsAdmin` function to determine if the ad.
