The Protocol SDK makes interacting with the ZORA protocol easier by generating required transactions for our contracts.

### Features

1. Mint existing 1155 NFTs and Premintable NFTs
2. Deploy new contracts and create new tokens
3. Create new Premint tokens (Gasless creation)

The SDK is written in typescript and can be installed via `npm`, `yarn`, etc. 
[Source Code](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-sdk)
