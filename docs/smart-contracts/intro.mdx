##### An introduction to the ZORA V3

---
ZORA V3 is comprised of a few core contracts and an ever expanding set of modules. 
Modules are non-upgradable contracts that add specific functionality to the protocol. 

* **Modules:** Contracts with specific functionality that can be added to ZORA V3

* **Module Manager:** Manages which modules a user has approved to use their tokens and which new modules can be added to the protocol

* **Transfer Helpers:** Handles transferring ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens for the modules

### Approving Tokens to V3
Tokens must first be approved to their respective Transfer Helper contracts before being able to be used by the ZORA modules. 
For example, all ERC-721 token approvals must be made to the ERC-721 Transfer Helper. 
Once completed, the user will then need to approve which modules can access their approved tokens by submitting a transaction to the Module Manager.
This means that a user will only need to approve each token contract to ZORA V3 once and then approve which ZORA modules can access to their tokens.

<br/>

### Approving Modules
Users can either approve a single ZORA module or selectively batch approve certain modules. 
Every time a new module is added to the protocol a user must opt in and approve the newly added module to access to their tokens.
Approving a module means that all tokens that have been approved to the Trasnfer Helpers will be able to be accessed by that module.

#### setApprovalForModule
Approves a single module to access a user's tokens.
```
setApprovalForModule(address _moduleAddress, bool _approved)
```

#### setBatchApprovalForModules
Approves a series of modules to access a user's tokens.
```
setBatchApprovalForModules(
  address[] memory _moduleAddresses, 
  bool _approved
) 
```
