##### Sell an NFT using a reserve auction

---
The `Auctions Module` allows anyone to sell an ERC-721 NFT using a reserve auction.
In a reserve auction, the seller sets a minimum price and only if a bid meets or exceeds the price will auction timer start.
You can view all of the `Auctions Module v1.0` code in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/tree/main/contracts/modules/ReserveAuction).



## Auction Variants
There are four different variants for the Auction Module. Each variant comes with different features and associated gas costs.


| Contract                                             | Supports ETH | Supports ERC-20 | Supports Finders Fee | Gas Costs |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------|
|[CoreETH](./zora-v3-auctions-coreETH-1.0)|   âœ…           |   ðŸš«            |     ðŸš«                | Lowest    |
|[CoreERC20](./zora-v3-auctions-coreERC20-1.0)         |   âœ…           |   âœ…            |     ðŸš«                | Medium    |
|[FindersETH](./zora-v3-auctions-finderETH-1.0)       |   âœ…           |   ðŸš«            |     âœ…                | Medium    |
|[FindersERC20](./zora-v3-auctions-finderERC20-1.0)|   âœ…           |   âœ…            |     âœ…                | Highest   |


#### Finders Fee
The Finders Fee is an optional amount offered to the party that helped match the highest bidder to the NFT. 
For example, a user creates an `auction` for one of the NFTs in their wallet. 
If a Finders Fee was specified, then the interface that helped match the NFT to the highest bidder could be entitled to that amount. 
Note that the Finders Fee is only charged if the auction completes.


#### Gas Costs 
Testing this line

#### Key Considerations âœ…
- An auction can be created by an owner or approved operator for any ERC-721 token.
- The auction timer will start when a bid is greater than or equal to the reserve price
- The NFT is only taken into custody when the first valid bid has been submitted
- The timer will be set back to 15 minutes if a bid is summitted within the last 15 minutes
- The percentage difference for a new bid must be greater than or equal to 10%
- Royalties are paid out using the [Manifold Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) when an auction ends
