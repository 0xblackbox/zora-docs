##### Sell an NFT at a fixed price

The `Asks Modules` allow for the sale of an ERC-721 at a fixed price.
You can view the code for all `Asks Modules` in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/tree/main/contracts/modules/Asks).

## Key Considerations üîë
- An `ask` can be created by an owner or approved operator for any ERC-721 token.
- There can only be one `ask` open at a time for a given NFT.
- Creating an `ask` for an ERC-721 token requires that the owner has previously approved the [ERC-721 Transfer Helper](../../../smart-contracts/zora-v3#approving-tokens-to-v3) for it to be valid.
- Royalties are paid out using the [Manifold Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) when an `ask` is filled.
