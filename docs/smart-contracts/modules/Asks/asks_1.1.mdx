##### Sell an NFT at a specific asking price

---
The `Asks Module` allows anyone to sell a `ERC-721` NFT for a specific asking price. 
You can view all of the `Ask V1.1 Module` contract code in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ourzora/v3/blob/main/contracts/modules/Asks/V1.1/AsksV1_1.sol).

### Ask Structure
An `ask` can be created by an owner or approved operator for any `ERC-721` token.
There can only be one valid `ask` open at a time for a given NFT. 
If an NFT is transferred to a new address the `ask` created by the previous address becomes invalid.
However, if the NFT were to be transferred back to the address that created the ask it would be valid again. 


* **seller:** The owner or approved address for an NFT
* **sellerFundsRecipient:** The address to send funds to once the NFT is sold
* **askCurrency:** ERC-20 token to accept, or address(0) for ETH
* **findersFeeBps:** The bps of the sale amount to be sent to the referrer of the sale
* **askPrice:** The sale price

```
struct Ask {
  address seller;
  address sellerFundsRecipient; 
  address askCurrency;
  uint16 findersFeeBps;
  uint256 askPrice;
}
```

<br/> 

### Finders Fee

The Finders Fee is the amount offered to the party that helped matched the buyer to the NFT.
For example, a user creates an `ask` for one of the NFTs in their wallet. 
If a finders fee was specified, then the interface that helped matched the NFT to the buyer could be entitled to that amount.
Note that the Finders Fee is only charged if a buyer fills the `ask` on an NFT.

<br/> 

### Honoring Royalties
Whenever an `ask` is filled, the `Ask V1 Module` respects any royalties in this [Royalty Registery](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/lookup) created by Manifold.
If your NFT contract doesn't currenctly support royalites, the owner address of an NFT contract is able to manually set the royalty in the registry.

### Read Functions 

#### askForNFT
A public mapping that returns an `ask` given a NFT token contract address and token id. 
Note that there can only ever be one `ask` open for an NFT at a time.

`mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Ask)) public askForNFT;`

  uint16 _findersFeeBps
)
```

#### setAskPrice
Updates the information for a specific `ask`.
```

  uint256 _askPrice,
  address _askCurrency

```

#### cancelAsk

function cancelAsk(address _tokenContract, uint256 _tokenId)
```

#### fillAsk 
Transfers the NFT to the buyer and sends the funds to the recipients.
```
function fillAsk(
